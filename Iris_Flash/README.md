# SPI NAND Flash Memory Drivers

Drivers for Micron NAND Flash 
- Supported Models
  - MT29F2G01ABAGD
- Dependencies
  - STM32 L0 Series Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL) 

Note: The STM32L0 HAL is used for SPI x1 data transfers to and from the NAND Flash IC. This driver set is meant to be used with STM32 Microcontrollers.

## Contents

In order of high level functions => hardware: 
- nand_m79a:
  - Functions for reading and writing to M79a NAND Flash ICs
- nand_m79a_lld:
  - Low level drivers implementing individual commands and dealing with physical locations within the NAND
- nand_spi:
  - SPI wrapper functions used by NAND driver
  - Calls STM32L0 HAL Library to interface with hardware

## Usage 

- Add `#include "nand_m79a.h"` to main.c
- Define the pins connecting to the NAND IC in `nand_spi.h`
  - `nand_spi.c` takes care of initializing the pins and the SPI interface for you.
  - Remove the auto generated `MX_SPIn_Init` (n is the one intended to be used with the NAND) from `main.c`. 
  - Same with any references to pins used by the NAND from `MX_GPIO_Init`.

## To-Do List

### Hardware 
- Validate driver functions

### Low level driver features (nand_m79a_lld)
- Finish implementing all of the commands
  - Read all registers, subfeatures
  - Read and write to spare areas
  - Move, lock operations
  - Read bad block bytes
  - Parameter page [Low priority]
  - OTP areas [Low priority]

- Optimize functions
  - NAND_Wait(1) wastes time. 
    - No command takes that long to complete.
    - Compounds when calling the function multiple times.

### Higher level features (nand_m79a)
- Handling storage levels and freeing up space as required [High priority]
- Bad-block management and mapping from logical addresses to physical locations [High priority]
- Wear leveling 
- Error correction code (ECC)
